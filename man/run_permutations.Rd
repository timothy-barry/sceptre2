\usage{
run_permutations(
  expressions,
  fitted_means,
  ground_truth_treatment_idxs,
  synthetic_treatment_idxs,
  response_theta
)
}
\arguments{
\item{expressions}{a vector of response expressions}

\item{fitted_means}{the vector of fitted means, obtained from regressing the expressions onto the technical factors}

\item{ground_truth_treatment_idxs}{indexes of the "treatment" cells on the ground truth data}

\item{synthetic_treatment_idxs}{indexes of the "treatment" cells under the resampled data}

\item{response_theta}{estimated theta of response expression distribution}
}
\value{
a list containing (i) z_star (the ground truth test statistic), (ii) z_null (the vector of resampled test statistics), and (iii) log_fold_change (the estimated log fold change)
}
\description{
Runs permutations using the NB score-test-based z statistic.
